        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Harboring a passion for books is considered to be a virtue. "Books are uniquely portable magic" said Stephen King a prominent american author. Aliens, monsters, dragons, fairies, witches and wizards, all come alive through stories. Books have the power to transport a reader to a fairyland, in space, a faraway land or in the ocean.

            Reading is always a personal preference. Even in a family, each member may pick a different book while visiting a library or a bookstore. One may wonder why so much emphasis is given to reading.
            <br>

            <br>

            3. Reading makes one more knowledgeable.
            <br>
            4. It is found that reading fiction books enhances the imagination of the readers. Visualization of the characters and the settings makes them more creative.
            <br>
            5. Reading books slowly refines one's vocabulary and thoughts. It eventually helps one write better.
            <br>

    <h6>The Evil Will Always Lose</h6>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>Long ago, there was a city named Chicago in USA. There lived a man in that city named Robert. He is a scientist and was working all day. He came late in the night. One day, decided to spend some time with his family His child, Richard and his wife, Lucy were very happy on hearing this. Richard was fond of horses His father taught him many breeds of horses when he was at a very young age. One day, when Richard went to school, he saw some of his friends fighting with other friends. When he came towards his friends, he saw his friends, Johnson, Jackie, George and Michael fighting with Emerson, Edward and Ronald. Richard asked them, “Why are you all fighting?” George replied, “Emerson took our books and is lying to us that he did not take them!” As Richard was an intelligent boy, Michael suggested, “Richard, can you prove that Emerson took our books?” Emerson was a little afraid, but he agreed. Richard saw Emerson’s backpack. It was a bit larger than usual. He found out that the books were in Emerson’s backpack. Emerson refused to show his backpack. George and Jackie held Emerson while Johnson pulled out his backpack and checked it. The books of George, Johnson, Jackie and Michael were in the backpack. They said this to their teacher who punished Emerson, Edward and Ronald. Emerson could not bear this and decided that one day he will kill Richard. George, Johnson, Jackie and Michael were grateful to Richard and they all became the best of friends. When Richard grew up, he bought home a horse and named it Swift. He trained it every day. Emerson bought a buffalo as he thought it would be the best animal to kill Richard. He named it Terro. Within a few days, the buffalo was doing what Emerson said. Emerson then made plans to kill Richard. He sat on his buffalo and started riding it finding where Richard was. When he saw Richard, he was shocked to find a horse with him. He decided to kill the horse first and then Richard. He asked Terro to attack Swift, but Swift escaped speedily. Seeing this Richard decided to make Swift strong. He made him do exercises and Swift was strong now. One day Emerson challenged Richard for a battle. Richard agreed. He called George, Johnson, Jackie and Michael with him for battling. He gave continuous training to Swift. Emerson was sleeping on his bed so Terro too slept. On the day of the battle, Emerson gathered Edward and Ronald for support. He went to the battle. After a continuous long battle that lasted for several days, Richard and his friends won the battle while Emerson, Edward and Ronald begged for mercy. Richard, being a kind man, made friends with Emerson, Edward and Ronald. They all lived together from that day. </h5>
